# Getting Started with D3 and the IPython Notebook

You will need to install IPython if you don't already have it.  I recommend the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution.

Make sure you have the latest packages.  Follow the [instructions](http://ipython.org/install.html).

Next download the contents of this repository

https://github.com/mlunacek/meetup_d3_2014/archive/master.zip

and unzip this in a location where you'd like to work.

Navigate to this location using your terminal (or CMD prompt for Windows) and type:

		ipython notebook --pylab=inline

You should be able to run the notebooks.
